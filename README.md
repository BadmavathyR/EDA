# EDA
To demonstrate working with an open-source dataset of approximately 50GB using PySpark, I'm using a large publicly available dataset from the AWS Public Datasets program. One such dataset is the "Common Crawl" dataset, which is a regularly updated collection of web data.

Here, I'll outline the steps to access this dataset, load it into a PySpark DataFrame, and perform some basic exploratory data analysis. Note that handling such large datasets requires sufficient computational resources, so ensure your environment is adequately configured (e.g., using an appropriately sized EC2 instance on AWS).

Steps:
  Set up your environment
  Access and load the data
  Perform EDA
To run this script, you'll need access to a Spark cluster configured to access AWS S3. You can set up a Spark cluster on AWS using Amazon EMR or similar services. Make sure to configure your Spark environment to handle large data volumes and provide adequate memory and CPU resources.

This script demonstrates loading and analyzing a large dataset using PySpark, focusing on basic EDA tasks.
